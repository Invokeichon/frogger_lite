# Frogger Lite

Small frogger-like game made as a way to learn C++ for a University assignment.


## Getting started

Before being able to compile the game using *CMake*, you must initialize the submodules.

In order to do this, after pulling the repo run the following command:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

With the submodules pulled from their respective repos, you can compile the game and try it for yourself!
